The player can currently play through a sandboxed Texas Holdem poker game.
The game progresses like an actual casino style game, but there are no other players to be concerned with.
The player is simply betting on the likelihood of getting a great hand, based on the cards they have each round.

## Programming Highlights:
- The game loop is simple and intuitive.
- The objects are all modular, and ready for use in a multiplayer version.
- I created a unique scoring system that will allow for determining winners with minimal overhead.
